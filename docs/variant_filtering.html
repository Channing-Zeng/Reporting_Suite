<h3 id="1-variant-calling">1. Variant calling</h3>
<p>Variants are found by <a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/VarDict">VarDict</a> (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27060149">Lai Z, 2016</a>), a versatile variant caller for cancer samples. In this articles, we focus at the following genomic variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)</li>
<li>Multiple nucleotide polymorphisms (MNP)</li>
<li>Small insertions and deletions</li>
<li>Complex composite variants</li>
<li>Somatic and LOH variants (in paired samples analysis)</li>
</ul>
<p>And the following types of sequencing assays:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whole genome (usually 20-60x), calling with 1% allele frequency threshold by default</li>
<li>Whole exome (usually 100-200x), 1% AF</li>
<li>Targeted (usually 300-10000x), 0.1% AF</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="target-regions">Target regions</h5>
<p>In exomes, the variant are called in a special target called AZ exome, that combines all Ensembl CDS and UTR regions, plus regions from commonly used panels padded by 50pb:</p>

<p>Variants in form of VCF file are annotated using <a href="http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/">SnpEff</a> tool that predicts effect of variants on gene function, in respect to RefSeq gene model. We predict based on canonical (longest) transcripts only, except for the following genes where the longest transcript is substituted with a smaller, but more cancer-relevant one:</p>
<pre><code>FANCL   NM_018062.3

<p>SnpEff assigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>gene and transcript IDs</li>
<li>gene biotype (coding/ncRNA/pseudogene)</li>
<li>if the variant is in intron/CDS/upstream/downstream/non-coding/splice site</li>
<li>mutation functional class (silent/missense/nonsense)</li>
<li>codon change</li>
<li>amino acid change</li>
</ul>
<p>Variants are also searched against the following variant databases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">COSMIC</a> &mdash; cancer somatic mutations database, assigns ID and hits count</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">dbSNP</a> &mdash; assigns rsID and CAF (global allele frequencies)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/">ClinVar</a> &mdash; assigns CLNSIG (clinical significance)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-raw-filtering-vardict-txt">3. Raw filtering: vardict.txt</h3>
<p>The first filtering step is performed using <a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/VarDict/blob/master/vcf2txt.pl">vcf2txt.pl</a> script from the VarDict package. It consumes an annotated VCF file from VarDict, annotated as described above, and produces <code>vardict.txt</code> tab-separated file in a specific format. The program (1) performs hard and soft filtering for low quality variants, (2) assigns <em>variant class</em> (&quot;novelty&quot;), (3) assigns <em>variant type</em> (CNV, MNV, deletion, insertion, complex).</p>
<p>Hard filtering (where the variants are discarded) is performed using the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locus total depth (&ge; 3x)</li>
<li>Mean position in reads (&ge; 5)</li>
<li>Mean base quality phred score (&ge; 25)</li>
</ul>
<p>Soft filtering (the variants are reported into <code>vardict.txt</code> with a reject reason in the <code>PASS</code> column) is done based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variant depth (&ge; 3x)</li>
<li>Mean mapping quality (&ge; 10)</li>
</ul>
<p>The thresholds are specified in the run_info.yaml configuration file. Depending on the analysis, it can be either of <a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/configs/run_info_ExomeSeq.yaml">run_info_ExomeSeq.yaml</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/configs/run_info_WGS.yaml">run_info_WGS.yaml</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/configs/run_info_DeepSeq.yaml">run_info_DeepSeq.yaml</a>; the defaults are pulled from <a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/tree/master/configs/RUNINFO_DEFAULTS.yaml">RUNINFO_DEFAULTS.yaml</a></p>
<p>The mutation class (<code>Var_Class</code>) is assigned in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>COSMIC</code> &mdash; any mutation found in COSMIC</li>
<li><code>ClnSNP_known</code> &mdash; any other mutation, labelled significant in ClinVar (3 &lt; <code>CLNSIG</code> &lt; 7)</li>
<li><code>dbSNP_del</code> &mdash; deletion found in dbSNP</li>
<li><code>dbSNP</code> &mdash; the remaining dbSNP variants</li>
<li><code>Novel</code> &mdash; all remaining variants</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of the script are saved under <code>final/YYYY-MM-DD_projectname/var/vardict.txt</code></p>
<h3 id="4-cancer-mutation-filtering-vardict-pass-txt">4. Cancer mutation filtering: vardict.PASS.txt</h3>
<p>This step consumes sample-level <code>vardict.txt</code> files and produces sample-level <code>vardict.PASS.txt</code>. It starts with dropping all soft-filtered variants in the previous step, and then removes cancer non-relevant germline mutations and potential artefacts, and classifies the remaining mutations based on their &#39;actionability&#39; (see the definition in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v16/n5/full/nrc.2016.35.html">Carr et al. 2015</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>known</code> (highly actionable)</li>
<li><code>likely</code> (could be actionable, but the evidence is more equivocal or limited)</li>
<li><code>unknown</code> (remaining high-quality variants with moderate impact)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="germline-and-known-common-artifacts">Germline and known common artifacts</h4>
<p>Germline SNPs occur at approximately 100%, 50%, or 0% frequency, and every effort is made to filter out germline variants. However, some germline variants are important, especially for tumor suppressor genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2. Germline mutations may be of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), and may be relevant when heterozygous, or only when the other allele is also affected in the tumor, further complicating decisions on actionability. </p>
<h5 id="heuristics">Heuristics</h5>
<p>Currently, the following is done in order to filter germline variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>In paired analysis, removing mutations appearing both in tumor and in normal match in similar frequency</li>
<li>Removing dbSNP common SNPs, reported in ClinVar with <code>CLNSIG</code> = <code>2</code> (<em>Benign</em>) or <code>3</code> (<em>Likely benign</em>), unless actionable</li>
<li>Removing variants with high global minor allele frequency (GMAF) in TCGA (&gt; 0.0025), unless actionable</li>
<li>Cohort filtering: removing <code>unknown</code> variants present in &ge; 40% samples and &gt; 5 samples</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="known-common-artifacts">Known common artifacts</h5>
<p>Variants are also checked against a list of positions and rules of common germline mutations and artifacts, similarly to actionable lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/reference_data/filtering/hg19/filter_common_artifacts.txt">filter_common_artifacts.txt</a> &mdash; genomic positions and rules. If rule, filter even if actionable. If position, filter if non-actionable and AF &lt; 35%.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/reference_data/filtering/common/actionable_hotspot.txt">actionable_hotspot.txt</a> &mdash; amino acid positions (removed even if actionable), records only starting with <code>^</code>, e.g.: <pre><code>- ^RBMX    G356W    1    Artifact in low complexity
- ^NQO1    P187S    1    Common germline SNP
</code></pre></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/reference_data/filtering/hg19/filter_common_snp.txt">filter_common_snp.txt</a> &mdash; genomic positions, removed if not actionable.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="msi">MSI</h5>
<p>Variations of lengths of long homopolymers often cause false positives, and require special treatment. For 1-nucleotide MSI of different lengths, a special AF cut-off is set: HP less than 7 units long, the AF cut-off is set to 3%; 8 - 6%; 9 - 12,5% 10 - 17.5%; 11- 25%; 12 - 30%; 12+ - 35%.</p>
<h4 id="tier-1-mdash-actionable-mutations-mdash-known-">Tier 1 &mdash; actionable mutations &mdash; <code>known</code></h4>
<p>Variants are checked against a set of rules that defined <em>actionable</em> (known driver) variants. Highly actionable mutations (robust evidence base and/or strong scientific rationale linking the mutation with probable sensitization to drug, and/or high likelihood of response in proposed trial and disease setting) are reported as <code>known</code>.</p>
<p>The rules may specify any specific descriptive feature of a variant, like gene, exon, genomic or protein position and change, genomic or protein region, type of change: deletion, frameshift deletion, insertion, frameshift insertion, indel, etc.</p>
<p>Amino acid changes, exons and codon numbers that define actionable somatic and germline changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/reference_data/filtering/common/actionable_hotspot.txt">actionable_hotspot.txt</a> &mdash; everything until records starting with <code>^</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/reference_data/filtering/common/specific_mutations.tsv">specific_mutations.tsv</a> &mdash; mutations under <code>TIER1</code> column</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/tree/master/reference_data/filtering/common/rules">TP53 rules</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Genomic positions that define actionable germline and somatic variants:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/reference_data/filtering/hg19/actionable.txt">actionable.txt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, variants found in ClinVar with a high significance (<code>CLNSIG</code> = <code>4</code> &mdash; <em>Likely pathogenic</em> or <code>5</code> &mdash; <em>Pathogenic</em>) are reported as <code>known</code>.</p>
<h4 id="tier-2-mdash-likely-">Tier 2 &mdash; <code>likely</code></h4>
<p>This class of mutations could be actionable, but no strong evidence supporting it observed. Reported as <code>likely</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>High-impact somatic variants:<ul>
<li>Frameshift</li>
<li>Stop gained</li>
<li>Start loss</li>
<li>Splice site mutation</li>
<li>LOF in a tumor suppressor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deletion reported in dbSNP (<code>Var_Class</code> = <code>dbSNP_del</code>)</li>
<li>COSMIC hotspots (only if at least 5 samples reported) (<code>Var_Class</code> = <code>COSMIC</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/reference_data/filtering/hg19/Compendia.MS7.Hotspot.txt">Compendia hotspots</a> (based on TCGA database)</li>
<li>Mutations under <code>TIER2</code> column in <a href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Reporting_Suite/blob/master/reference_data/filtering/common/specific_mutations.tsv">specific_mutations.tsv</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tier-3-mdash-unknown-">Tier 3 &mdash; <code>unknown</code></h4>
<p>Evidence insufficient to classify as actionable or justify using in patient treatment decision at this time. </p>
<ul>
<li>Moderate impact mutation (missense, inframe indels)</li>
<li>Reported in ClinVar with <code>CLNSIG</code> = <code>0</code> (<em>Uncertain significance</em>) or <code>255</code> (<em>other</em>)</li>
<li>Any silent unknown mutations are reported as <code>silent</code> in the <code>Reason</code> column (and reported for driver analysis that compares mutations with silent background)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="allele-frequency-thresholds">Allele frequency thresholds</h4>
<p>The AF thresholds are set:</p>
<ul>
<li>WGS: 5% for actionable mutations, 7.5% for the rest mutations</li>
<li>Exome: 2.5% for actionable mutations, 7.5% for the rest mutations</li>
<li>Deep sequencing: 0.2% for for actionable mutations, 0.5% for the rest mutations, </li>
</ul>
<p>For germline actionable mutations, a special threshold is set to 15%.</p>
<p>Thresholds are driven partly by confidence in differentiating real tumor mutations at low AF from artefacts in tumor sequencing data, but also by an assumption that very-low-frequency events may have little or no relevance to tumour progression and treatment response.</p>
<p>When interpreting results, focus on somatic variants above ~30% allele frequency for cell line and explant models, above ~5% and above for tumors, and above ~0.7% for ctDNA.</p>
<h4 id="non-callable-genes-and-regions">Non-callable genes and regions</h4>
<p>Mutations belonging to any gene from the following blacklist are always removed:</p>
<pre><code>RBMX

KMT2C

<ul>
<li>Gene filtering &mdash; exome level<ul>
<li>Filter all variant from the following published genes from three papers &mdash; people agree these genes generate too many false positives and represent (“blacklist” tab, rows 1-158, genes ABCA13 through ZNF407). Rows 74 and 75 &mdash; perhaps keep KMT2C and KMT2D from being hard filtered for now, given their prominence on cancer gene panels. But I want them filtered from AZ50/AZ300/targeted panel reports.</li>
<li>Filter all variants from large gene families and other genome oddities &mdash; various ways I’ve found, scanned in a genome viewer, and tagged (“blacklist” tab, rows 159-500). I’ve tried to differentiate when essentially every exon is in a low complexity region, versus some or most. Searching for long regions of low Duke 35 mappability would be a comprehensive way to do this</li>
<li>(Row 502) We need to flag genes in the MHC region, in particular those in the region but not clearly involved in MHC/HLA/IO, given their high polymorphism and alternate haplotype structure</li>
<li>Row 503-520 &mdash; filter our every olfactory receptor gene &mdash; I have had them cluttering up reports for over a decade, if we miss something important someday, blame it on me.</li>
<li>Row 522 onwards  &mdash; I am beginning to hand-check exome reports as well as AZ300 – this will be very tricky as these are small regions of cancer genes with recurrent mutations – often due to low complexity regions (let’s figure out how to systematically filter with that low complexity repeat-masker track) or short interstitial repeats where one copy is deleted and picked up by Vardict as a complex mutation. Also, homopolymer mononucleotide repeats less than 8 can result in a mutation at a lower frequency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cohort-filtering">Cohort filtering</h4>
<p>If the samples are not homogeneous, but come from single sequencer&#39;s run, we expect recurring variants to be caused by sequencing artefacts. Also, too common mutations are expected to be germline. For all non-known and non-actionable variants, we calculate the number and the percentage of samples harbouring this variant. If it&#39;s more than 40% of all samples and at the same time at least 5 samples, such variants are filtered out. Cohort filtering is done on the stage of merging all sample-level <code>vardict.PASS.txt</code> into the project level <code>vardict.PASS.txt</code> located in <code>final/&lt;datestamp&gt;</code> directory.</p>
<h3 id="output-format">Output format</h3>
<p><code>vardict.PASS.txt</code> is a tab-separated format that contains one record per protein change (e.g. several lines per genomic change can occur in case of overlapping genes or isoforms, although usually only one transcript per gene is analysed). </p>

</code></pre><h3 id="5-reporting">5. Reporting</h3>
<p>Mutations are reported into NGS Oncology reports. For WES and WGS projects, the reports shows only mutations in 817 key cancer genes. If it&#39;s a targeted panel (the total number of genes is less than 2000), the target genes are used instead.</p>
<p><img src="ngs_report.png" alt="NGS report"></p>
<p>By default, only <code>known</code> and <code>likely</code> changes are displayed. Clicking the &quot;+ unknown&quot; link will add <code>unknown</code> changes into the table too. </p>
<p>The changes overlapping regions with poor callability are faded.</p>
