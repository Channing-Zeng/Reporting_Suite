#  min_p_mean:   5       # PMEAN.  -p   The minimum mean position in reads for variants.
#  min_q_mean:   25      # QUAL.   -q   The minimum mean base quality phred score for variant.
#
#  filt_depth:   0       # DP.     -D   The filtering total depth. The raw variant will be filtered on first place if the total depth is less then [filt_depth].
#  filt_q_mean:  0       # QUAL.   -Q   The filtering mean position in reads for variants. The raw variant will be filtered on first place if the mean posititon is less then [filt_p_mean].
#  filt_p_mean:  0       # PMEAN.  -P   The filtering mean base quality phred score for variants. The raw variant will be filtered on first place if the mean quality is less then [filt_q_mean].
#
#  min_mq:       10      # MQ.     -M   The filtering mean mapping quality score for variants. The raw variant will be filtered if the mean mapping quality score is less then specified.
#  min_vd:       2       # VD.     -V   The filtering variant depth. Variants with depth < [min_vd] will be considered false positive.

#  signal_noise: 1.5     # SN.     -o   Signal/noise value.
#
#  bias:         False   #         -b   Filter novel or dbSNP variants with strand bias "2;1" or "2;0" (BIAS field) and AF < 0.3.
