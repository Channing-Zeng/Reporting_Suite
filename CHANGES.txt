v1.0.0, 26 Feb 2016
New features:
- Using McEwen, Robert and Hedley's rules and manual curations - 3 tiers
- Standalone script for variant annotation and filtration - variants.py
- TargQC detailed coverage stats for unmerged regions
- RefSeq CDS + Transcripts + miRNA exons in TargQC detailed reports; RefSeq CDS for Seq2C
- Extended summary HTML: phenotype info, project and codebase datestamps and versions
- New snpEff 4.2
- Using the same RefSeq canonical transcripts list to report coverage and mutation effects
- NGS oncology report with many new features: Allele frequency plot, flagged regions, downloadable tables, Seq2C for whole profile
- Integration and exposing to jBrowse, includes convertion to BigWig
- Integration with LIMS
- Support bcbio 0.10.0

Optimization
- Memory efficient vcf2txt.pl - first round filtering script
- Using BCFTools, which is faster and memory efficient, but also which addresses problem of compressed VCF refernce data in hg19/hg38 notation
- Using tweaked sambamba for region coverage calculation - faster and memory effecient, and works for unmerged regions

Fixes
- Fix issue when a intergenic/intragenic change is annotated by COSMIC as a missence change from another gene
- Fix occasionally missing dbSNP annotations in chr1
- Internally referring to genes by symbol+chromosome rather than by symbol, which fixes some region annotation
