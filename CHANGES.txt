v1.0.0, 28 Feb 2016

New features:
- New mutation filtering: using rules and manual curations by Robert McEwen and Hedley Carr. Reporting clasification assignment rationale.
- Standalone script for variant annotation and filtration - variants.py
- TargQC detailed coverage stats for unmerged regions.
- Using canonical RefSeq transcripts (coding and miRNA) for TargQC detailed reports. The same RefSeq canonical transcripts are used to report mutation effects, and RefSeq CDS are used for Seq2C cnv calls.
- Extended summary HTML: phenotype info, project and codebase datestamps, and versions.
- New snpEff 4.2.
- NGS oncology report has many new features: Allele frequency plot, flagged regions, exportable data, Seq2C plos for whole profile.
- Integration and exposing mutations, regions and alignment data to jBrowse. Includes convertion to BigWig.
- Integration with LIMS to pull sample data.
- Support bcbio 0.9.6.

Optimization
- Memory efficient vcf2txt.pl (first round filtering script) - saving 80% of memory.
- Using BCFTools, which is faster and memory efficient, but also which addresses problem of compressed VCF reference data in hg19/hg38 notation.
- Using tweaked sambamba for region coverage calculation - faster and memory effecient, and also works for unmerged regions.

Fixes
- Fix issue when a intergenic/intragenic change is annotated by COSMIC as a missence change from another gene.
- Fix occasionally missing dbSNP annotations in chr1.
- Internally referring to genes by symbol+chromosome rather than by symbol, which fixes some region annotation.
