variant_filtering:
# fraction:           0.4
  max_ratio:          0.75    # When a variant is present in more than [max_ratio] of samples, and AF < 0.3, it's considered as likely false positive, even if it's in COSMIC.

# # When a novel variant (non-dbSNP, non-COSMIC) is detected in greater or equal _sample_cnt_ samples, is present in more than _fraction_ of samples; and the avarage allele frequency is less than _freq_, it's considered as likely false positive.
# sample_cnt:         10
# ave_freq:           0.15
# count_undetermined: True    # Undeteremined won't be counted for the sample count. Not used 'cause we don't actually have any undetermined samples.

# min_p_mean:         5       # PMEAN.  The minimum mean position in reads for variants.
# min_q_mean:         25      # QUAL.   The minimum mean base quality phred score for variant.

  filt_depth:         5       # DP.     The filtering total depth. The raw variant will be filtered on first place if the total depth is less then [filt_depth].
# filt_p_mean:        0       # QUAL.   The filtering mean position in reads for variants. The raw variant will be filtered on first place if the mean posititon is less then [filt_p_mean].
# filt_q_mean:        0       # PMEAN.  The filtering mean base quality phred score for variants. The raw variant will be filtered on first place if the mean quality is less then [filt_q_mean].

  min_freq:           0.01    # AF.     When individual allele frequency < freq for variants, it was considered likely false poitives.
                              # By default, min_allele_fraction in the bcbio-nextgen YAML is taken instead.
# min_mq:             10      # MQ.     The filtering mean mapping quality score for variants. The raw variant will be filtered if the mean mapping quality score is less then specified.
  min_vd:             3       # VD.     The filtering variant depth. Variants with depth < [min_vd] will be considered false positive.

# maf:                0.0025  # GMAF.   If there's MAF with frequency, it'll be considered dbSNP regardless of COSMIC.
# signal_noise:       1.5     # SN.     Signal/noise value.

# bias:               False   # Filter novel or dbSNP variants with strand bias "2;1" or "2;0" (BIAS field) and AF < 0.3.
