variant_filtering:
  filt_depth:         5       # DP.     The filtering total depth. The raw variant will be filtered on first place if the total depth is less then [filt_depth].

  max_ratio:          0.75    # When a variant is present in more than [max_ratio] of samples, and AF < 0.3, it's considered as likely false positive, even if it's in COSMIC.
  min_freq:           0.5     # AF.     When individual allele frequency < freq for variants, it was considered likely false poitives.
                              # By default, min_allele_fraction in the bcbio-nextgen YAML is taken instead.
